# Props Assignment 2

We will continue working on the E-commerce store. You will need to do:

1. Create and checkout to a branch called `props`
2. In the `ProductCard` component, log to the console the price of the item `onMouseOver`
3. In the `ProductCardContainer` component, create an event handler that will fire a browser alert that says `You added {product name}`
   1. The `ProductCard` component should accept as a prop the event handler defined in `ProductCardContainer`
   2. Fire the passed event when the `add to cart`button is clicked
4. Push your code to GitHub open a Pull Request comparing `develop` to `master`, and submit a link to the PR in Omnivox
